# Catel.Benchmarks

Benchmarks for Catel classes so they can be compared.

## How to run benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, run the `Catel.BenchmarkCombiner` project. It should have all the other console applications as build dependencies.

## Viewing results

The results will automatically be exported to the `/results` folder. We are still working on a combined report that compares all the different versions.
